          Though intelligent, LeChuck displays a ruthless and sadistic
          disposition, with little regard for human life. Throughout the series
          he is driven by a megalomaniacal desire for power and by his love of
          the series' lead female character, Elaine Marley. LeChuck frequently
          attempts to make Elaine his undead bride, regardless of Elaine's own
          views on the matter. Following his defeat in the first game of the
          series, LeChuck fosters a deep hatred towards protagonist Guybrush
          Threepwood, whom he recognises a real threat to his plans due to
          Threepwood's resourcefulness. By Escape from Monkey Island LeChuck
          regrets having missed the opportunity to simply kill Guybrush in the
          past, having preferred the opportunity to gloat in victory over
          eliminating his enemy. Despite his intellect, LeChuck is arrogant and
          overconfident, and can be gullible, which often leads to his downfall.
