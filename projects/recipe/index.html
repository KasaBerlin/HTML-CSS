        My dog, Cookie, and I have been visiting the vet three times a week
        lately. We don’t mind the excursion. The girls behind the desk are fun
        to be around and Cookie loves the attention. She has quickly become a
        staff favorite (of course!). It’s also a prime spot for people watching.
        I always feel like I’m experiencing that 101 Dalmations scene where all
        of the dogs match their owners, remember that one? The manly men bring
        in their 80-pound manly-man breeds who shake their heads like lions.
        Eccentrically dressed older ladies wait with their dachshunds and shaggy
        little dogs. A beautiful, elegant blond woman picks up her equally
        elegant and blond mystery breed. The lady with a high-pitched voice and
        nervous laugh tells me about her rat terrier. I suppose Cookie and I
        match, too. I will shamelessly admit that we both have great hair, and
        it doesn’t hurt that I’m always dressed in black or gray. butternut and
        sage During the more dull moments, I’ve spent a fair amount of time
        flipping through Instagram photos and glancing at the heart worm
        brochures on the side table. I grabbed the February issue of Bon Appetit
        before I left for our last appointment so I would have something to read
        while I waited. I’m glad I did, because I was reminded of the butternut
        squash carbonara that I had dog-eared earlier. cooked butternut and
        linguine How to Make Vegan Butternut Squash Linguine Bon Appetit’s
        recipe called for pancetta and chicken broth, but I knew I could easily
        make it vegetarian and amp up the flavor with spices. The cooking
        technique is what really caught my eye—basically, you make a butternut
        purée while you cook pasta, then marry the two together in a warm pan
        with the help of some starchy reserved pasta cooking water. Genius,
        right? It’s even easier to make than the béchamel that I made for my
        pumpkin fettuccine alfredo. The best part is that the puréed squash is
        rich and luxuriously creamy without any cream at all. I also used whole
        grain pasta, which further prevented the steamroller after-effects of
        eating a giant bowl of creamy carbs. Make this before the weather warms
        up! If you’re in the market for more lightened-up, creamy pasta recipes,

        INSTRUCTIONS Warm the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the
        oil is shimmering, add the sage and toss to coat. Let the sage get
        crispy before transferring it to a small bowl. Sprinkle it lightly with
        salt and set the bowl aside. Add the squash, onion, garlic and red
        pepper flakes to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook,
        stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 8 to 10
        minutes. Add the broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the
        heat and simmer until the squash is soft and the liquid is reduced by
        half, about 15 to 20 minutes. In the meantime, bring a large pot of
        salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente according to
        package directions, stirring occasionally. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta
        cooking water before draining. Once the squash mixture is done cooking,
        remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly. Transfer the contents
        of the pan to a blender, but keep the skillet handy. Purée the mixture
        until smooth (beware of hot steam escaping from the top of the blender),
        then season with salt and pepper until the flavors sing. In the reserved
        skillet, combine the pasta, squash purée and ¼ cup cooking liquid. Cook
        over medium heat, tossing and adding more pasta cooking water as needed,
        until the sauce coats the pasta, about 2 minutes. Season with more salt
        and pepper if necessary. Serve the pasta in individual bowls topped with
        fried sage, more black pepper and shaved Parmesan/Pecorino and/or smoked
        salt, if desired. NOTES Recipe adapted from Bon Appetit’s Winter Squash
        Carbonara with Pancetta and Sage (February 2014). MAKE IT VEGAN: Skip
        the cheese garnish. MAKE IT GLUTEN-FREE: Use gluten-free pasta.
        Commenter Jenn recommends corn and quinoa blended gluten-free pasta,
        which is firmer than brown rice pasta. CHANGE IT UP: The squash purée is
        a killer bisque, which you could thin with vegetable broth if you’d
        like. You could also stir it into risotto at the end of cooking.
